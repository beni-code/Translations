The process of filling in the horizontal spans of pixels belong-ing to a primitive is called rasterization.
<span class="translateSpan" title="GPU 计算每个像素的深度、插值顶点颜色和插值纹理坐标。">The GPU calculates the depth, interpo-lated vertex colors, and interpolated texture coordinates for each pixel.</span>
This in-formation, combined with the location of the pixel itself, is called a fragment.</p>
